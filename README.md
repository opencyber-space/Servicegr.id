# ⚙️ Functions and Tools Ecosystem

**A unified framework for registering, discovering, and executing computational functions and developer tools across distributed systems.**
Standardized, policy-aware, and built to power modular AI, automation, and orchestration workflows.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

### 🧩 Unified Function & Tool Lifecycle

* 📦 Upload structured bundles (`spec.json`, source archives, docs)
* 🧾 Register with metadata, execution configs, and API contracts
* 🔁 Update or retire entries with versioned and policy-controlled workflows
* 🚦 DSL-based selection and validation across agent workflows

### 🧠 Intelligent Execution Infrastructure

* 🧠 Use LLMs or DSLs to discover optimal functions or tools for a task
* 🛠️ Seamlessly switch between REST, WebSocket, or gRPC protocols
* 🔐 Enforce permission and cost models through runtime policy hooks
* 🧮 Integrate estimation and pre-validation before execution

### 🔍 Discoverability and Orchestration

* 🔍 Query by type, tags, metadata (REST + GraphQL)
* 🕸️ Composable DSL and GraphQL layers for orchestration engines
* 🤖 Auto-load tools/functions based on runtime requirements
* ⚙️ Supports DAG-style execution of multi-step workflows

## 📦 Use Cases

| Use Case                        | What It Enables                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Distributed Tool Execution**  | Trigger system or custom tools across Kubernetes nodes via gRPC |
| **Function-as-a-Service Layer** | Host and discover functions exposed over HTTP or WebSocket      |
| **Agent Skill Mapping**         | Dynamically associate tools/functions with agent capabilities   |
| **Action-Based Workflows**      | Use DSL plans to select tools/functions with approvals          |
| **Secure System Automation**    | Gate privileged system calls via policies and mapped RPC rules  |

## 🧩 Integrations

| Component             | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **MongoDB**           | Primary store for tool/function metadata and specs     |
| **Redis**             | TTL-based caching for execution, validation, workflows |
| **S3 / Ceph**         | Store uploaded source archives and assets              |
| **Policy DB Webhook** | Validate execution permissions and register code refs  |
| **Flask / gRPC**      | Serve REST APIs, GraphQL, and RPC interfaces           |

## 💡 Why Use This?

| Problem                                                 | Our Solution                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 No unified registry for code artifacts and endpoints | Maintain centralized, queryable registries for all components |
| 🔹 Manual tool selection and orchestration              | Use LLMs or DSL plans for intelligent task execution          |
| 🔹 Untrusted or unverified execution of system tools    | Route via permission-controlled gRPC runtime environments     |
| 🔹 Lack of metadata consistency across services         | Standardized registration, APIs, and spec validation          |
